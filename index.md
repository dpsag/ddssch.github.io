# dpstudio AG docs - SSOT

Welcome to dpstudio AG's documentation site.

This is intended to be the single source of truth for both internal guidelines,
best practices, api usage and so on.

At dpstudio we strive to be as open and clear as possible.
For that reason these docs is written in english and is publicly available for everyone to enjoy.

If you find any errors or want to contribute feel free to make a PR.

Thank you,

Roberto Cabassi Bombardieri

Team dpstudio
